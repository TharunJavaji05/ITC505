    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>
        The project required me to construct playable "Lights Out" game logic through the combination of HTML and CSS with JavaScript.
        The first step was designing a 5x5 grid in which I implemented logic for square toggling with neighbor activation during clicks.
        I ran computer-generated random legal moves through simulations on blank boards in order to make sure the game was capable of being solved.
    </p>
    <p>
     The application benefits from CSS Grid layout system with basic stylistic elements along with hover and transition effects to simplify the user experience.
     The solution to edge cases during neighbor toggling required boundary checks when I encountered this challenge.
  
    </p>
    <p>
     The project deepened my comprehension of using DOM manipulation and event handling and developing interactive features in JavaScript.
